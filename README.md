# AMC Forth

This project is for developing an in-game Forth engine that will be used as a flight computer in the AMC SkyDart spacecraft, a craft built by the American Motors Corporation in a fictional 1990. The SkyDart is featured in the upcoming [Tungsten Moon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3104900/Tungsten_Moon/) game.
